Restart of English language-learning. July 2021
===============================================

Directories:
* run-1 -- attempt to have a perfect run-through of everything. (July 2021)
* run-2 -- work with a flawed copy of tranche-1 only
* run-3 -- Similarity Smackdown - compare MI to overlap, jaccard, etc. (Aug 2021)
* run-4 -- Deep trimming of datasets (Sept 2021)
* run-5 -- Trimming of word-pair files.
* run-6 -- All similarities between top-ranked words.
* run-7 -- Exploring one merge at a time.


Databases in the `~/data` directory
===================================

* run-1-en_pairs-tranche-1.rdb -- run-1 guten-tranche-1 only.
* run-1-en_pairs-tranche-12.rdb -- run-1 guten-tranche-1 and 2.
* run-1-en_pairs-tranche-12*.rdb -- etc.

* run-1-t1*-tsup-1-1-1.rdb -- MPG-parsed and correctly trimmed, see run-5, run-6
     and diary part three. Includes MM^T marginals.

* r2-en_pairs.rdb -- just pair counts for guten-tranche-1 only.
     Above is missing 400+ files. There were some crashes.
     Part of run-2 -- includes MI

* r2-mpg_parse.rdb -- MPG disjunct counts for above aka run-2.
     This includes the MM^T marginals.

* r3-* -- Assorted Similarilty Smackdown databases.

* r6-similarity-tsup.rdb -- copy of run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb with MI for
     word-pairs between the top 1200 wordvecs computed.

...THE END...
