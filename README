===============================================

Directories:
* run-1 -- attempt to have a perfect run-through of everything.
* run-2 -- work with a flawed copy of tranche-1 only


Databases in the `~/data` directory
===================================

* run-1-en_pairs-tranche-1.rdb -- run-1 guten-tranche-1 only.
* run-1-en_pairs-tranche-2.rdb -- run-1 guten-tranche-1 and 2.

* r2-en_pairs.rdb -- just pair counts for guten-tranche-1 only.
     Above is missing 400+ files. There were some crashes.
     Part of run-2 -- includes MI
