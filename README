Directories:
* run-1 -- attempt to have a perfect run-through of everything. (July 2021)

Databases in the `~/data` directory
===================================

* run-1-en_pairs-tranche-1.rdb -- run-1 guten-tranche-1 only.
* run-1-en_pairs-tranche-12.rdb -- run-1 guten-tranche-1 and 2.
* run-1-en_pairs-tranche-12*.rdb -- etc.

* r2-en_pairs.rdb -- just pair counts for guten-tranche-1 only.
