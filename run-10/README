Run-10 -- Merge Validation
--------------------------
Dec 2021

Pick up where run-9 left off.  After much confusion, it appears there
are multiple bugs. Several have been fixed, one is outstanding. The
marginals in the run-9 datasets are probably OK. Just that they were
not being loaded on restart.

To recompute the marginals, do this:
Starting point is a copy of `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb`.

```
$ mv run-1-t1234-shape.rdb run-1-t1234-shape-borked.rdb
```
Start from scratch with the shapes:

```
$ cp -pr run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb run-1-t1234-shape.rdb
```
Then recompute by running `marginals-mst-shape.scm` aka
`run/3-mst-parsing/compute-mst-marginals.sh`
```
. 0-pipeline.sh
cd ${COMMON_DIR}/
../run/3-mst-parsing/compute-mst-marginals.sh
```

OK, this gives the same-old:
Wildcard: (EvaluationLink (ctv 0 0 2.29426e+07)
  (PredicateNode "*-Direct Sum Wild (gram-classâŠ•cross-section)")
  (AnyNode "left-wild-direct-sum")
  (AnyNode "right-wild-direct-sum"))

and reviewing the code, this is correct, it seems.

-------------------------------------------
Partial debug is in  r10-dbg-b.rdb which is r9-sim-200.rdb plus
manual merge but no connector merge of one sections
