Run-10 -- Merge Validation
--------------------------
Dec 2021

Pick up where run-9 left off.  After much confusion, it appears there
are multiple bugs. Several have been fixed, one is outstanding.
Several more have been fixed, but still trouble!

The marginals in the run-9 datasets are probably OK. Just that they
were not being loaded on restart.

To recompute the marginals, do this:
Starting point is a copy of `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb`.

```
$ mv run-1-t1234-shape.rdb run-1-t1234-shape-borked.rdb
```
Start from scratch with the shapes:

```
$ cp -pr run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb run-1-t1234-shape.rdb
```
Then recompute by running `marginals-mst-shape.scm` aka
`run/3-mst-parsing/compute-mst-marginals.sh`
```
. 0-pipeline.sh
cd ${COMMON_DIR}/
../run/3-mst-parsing/compute-mst-marginals.sh
```

OK, this gives the same-old:
Wildcard: (EvaluationLink (ctv 0 0 2.29426e+07)
  (PredicateNode "*-Direct Sum Wild (gram-classâŠ•cross-section)")
  (AnyNode "left-wild-direct-sum")
  (AnyNode "right-wild-direct-sum"))

and reviewing the code, this is correct, it seems.

-------------------------------------------
Partial debug is in  r10-dbg-b.rdb which is r9-sim-200.rdb plus
manual merge but no connector merge of one sections

-------------------------------------------
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 1)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)

-------------------------------------------
5 Jan 2022 Wow. Looks like merged got fully debugged.
That took ... two weeks. Ouch.

So lets restart.

```
cd ~/data
cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r10-merge.rdb
. ~/experiments/run-10/4-gram-conf-en.sh
cd ~/src/learn/run-common
guile -l cogserver-gram.scm
```

then
```
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 1)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)
```


The End
