Run-10 -- Merge Validation
--------------------------
Dec 2021

Pick up where run-9 left off.  After much confusion

It appears that marginals
were miscomputed in the run-9 datasets, so we have to do
them again. Like so:

Starting point is a copy of `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb`.

```
$ mv run-1-t1234-shape.rdb run-1-t1234-shape-borked.rdb
```
The above had wild-wild card at 
`(PredicateNode "*-Direct Sum Wild (gram-class⊕cross-section)")`
which ... I thought was wrong, but appears to be correct. WTF.

Start from scratch with the shapes:

```
$ cp -pr run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb run-1-t1234-shape.rdb
```
Then recompute by running `marginals-mst-shape.scm` aka
`run/3-mst-parsing/compute-mst-marginals.sh`
```
. 0-pipeline.sh
cd ${COMMON_DIR}/
../run/3-mst-parsing/compute-mst-marginals.sh
```

OK, this gives the same-old:
Wildcard: (EvaluationLink (ctv 0 0 2.29426e+07)
  (PredicateNode "*-Direct Sum Wild (gram-class⊕cross-section)")
  (AnyNode "left-wild-direct-sum")
  (AnyNode "right-wild-direct-sum"))

and reviewing the code, this is I guess correct. So we still don't know
where the bug is.
