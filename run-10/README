Run-10 -- Merge Validation
--------------------------
Dec 2021

Pick up where run-9 left off.  It appears that marginals
were miscomputed in the run-9 datasets, so we have to do
them again. Like so:

Starting point is a copy of `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb`.

```
$ mv run-1-t1234-shape.rdb run-1-t1234-shape-borked.rdb
```
The above had wild-wild card at 
`(PredicateNode "*-Direct Sum Wild (gram-classâŠ•cross-section)")`
which is wrong. So we start from scratch with the shapes:

```
$ cp -pr run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb run-1-t1234-shape.rdb


$ guile -l cogserver.scm
(use-modules (srfi srfi-1))
(define pca (make-pseudo-cset-api))
(define pcs (add-pair-stars pca))
(define sha (add-covering-sections pcs))

(sha 'fetch-pairs)
(sha 'explode-sections)

; Already done...
; (define bat (batch-transpose sha))
; (bat 'mmt-marginals)

; XXX Says "already done" above, but that seems wrong. Try again.

The End
