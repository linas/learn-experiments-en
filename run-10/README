Run-10 -- Merge Validation
--------------------------
Dec 2021

Pick up where run-9 left off.  After much confusion, it appears there
are multiple bugs. Several have been fixed, one is outstanding.
Several more have been fixed, but still trouble!

The marginals in the run-9 datasets are probably OK. Just that they
were not being loaded on restart.

To recompute the marginals, do this:
Starting point is a copy of `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb`.

```
$ mv run-1-t1234-shape.rdb run-1-t1234-shape-borked.rdb
```
Start from scratch with the shapes:

```
$ cp -pr run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb run-1-t1234-shape.rdb
```
Then recompute by running `marginals-mst-shape.scm` aka
`run/3-mst-parsing/compute-mst-marginals.sh`
```
. 0-pipeline.sh
cd ${COMMON_DIR}/
../run/3-mst-parsing/compute-mst-marginals.sh
```

OK, this gives the same-old:
Wildcard: (EvaluationLink (ctv 0 0 2.29426e+07)
  (PredicateNode "*-Direct Sum Wild (gram-classâŠ•cross-section)")
  (AnyNode "left-wild-direct-sum")
  (AnyNode "right-wild-direct-sum"))

and reviewing the code, this is correct, it seems.

-------------------------------------------
Partial debug is in  r10-dbg-b.rdb which is r9-sim-200.rdb plus
manual merge but no connector merge of one sections

-------------------------------------------
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 1)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)

-------------------------------------------
5 Jan 2022 Wow. Looks like merged got fully debugged.
That took ... two weeks. Ouch.

So lets restart.

```
cd ~/data
cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r10-merge.rdb
. ~/experiments/run-10/4-gram-conf-en.sh
cd ~/src/learn/run-common
guile -l cogserver-gram.scm
```

then
```
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 100)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)
```

After 26 merges,
```
cp -pr r10-merge.rdb r10-merge-m26.rdb
```

Log of merge activity:
```
(print-log #t)
(print-merges #t)
```

```
cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r10-merge.rdb
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 100)
mv r10-merge.rdb r10-mrg-q0.5-c0.2.rdb

cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r10-mrg-q0.6-c0.3.rdb
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.6 0.3 4 200 100)

cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r10-mrg-q0.7-c0.4.rdb
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.7 0.4 4 200 100)

cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r10-mrg-q0.8-c0.5.rdb
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.8 0.5 4 200 100)
```

File sizes: r9-sim-200.rdb is 9.5 GB

-------------------------------------------
Results:
r10-mrg-q0.8-c0.5.rdb died prematurely. Although it did 986 merges,
It resulted in only 502 classes. Also, NONE of the MemberLinks were
recorded! Ouch!

Also: some of the above were restarted part-way through, and are thus
missing MemberLinks also. Basically, these are junk datasets. Will
be deleted fortwith.

-------------------------------------------
Track entropies, too.
```
cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r9-sim-200+entropy.rdb
guile -l cogserver-gram.scm
(define cfr (make-compute-freq star-obj))
(cfr 'init-freq)
(cfr 'cache-all)
; 2777968 -- correct
(define ent-obj (add-entropy-compute star-obj))
(ent-obj 'cache-all-right-entropy)
; Finished right entropy subtotals in 107 secs
(ent-obj 'right-entropy) ; 8.514785640953038
(define store-obj (make-store  star-obj))
(store-obj 'store-wildcards)
```
Cannot cache, cause the right's are missing.

du -s
9578520 r9-sim-200.rdb
9866940 r9-sim-200+entropy.rdb

-------------------------------------------

```
cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r9-sim-200+mi.rdb
guile -l cogserver-gram.scm
(batch-all-pair-mi star-obj)
```
Finished with MI computations; this took 3.134 hours.

-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
Debug notes below.
-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
More issues.
Start with
r10-merge-m10.rdb
which shows that totals look OK.
then ((add-support-compute star-obj) 'cache-all)
now the totals are wrong:
Total observations: 23666688.0 instead of 22942644.0
wtf ... is this due to the crash, or due to something else?
-------------------------------------------
So do one at a time.

cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r10-singles.rdb
guile -l cogserver-gram.scm
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 1)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)        ; still looks good
((add-support-compute star-obj) 'cache-all)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)        ; still looks good

 So maybe the crash was bad?
Do 9 more...
((add-support-compute star-obj) 'cache-all)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)        ; still looks good

Close and reload...
((add-support-compute star-obj) 'cache-all)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)        ; now its bad...
Total observations: 23807577.0

Again ...
cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r10-singles.rdb
guile -l cogserver-gram.scm
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 1)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)        ; still looks good
exit, reload,
Total observations: 22942644.0  ; still looks good

(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 1)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)        ; WRONG!
Error: left and right total pairs not equal! 2759540.0 2725049.0
Error: left and right total counts not equal! 23112769.0 22942644.0

((add-support-compute star-obj) 'cache-all)

Total observations: 22942644.0

Wow! That fixed it! ... OK, there's a bug in the marginals calcs.
Where?

-------------------------------------------
Do it again.

cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r10-singles.rdb
guile -l cogserver-gram.scm
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 1)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)        ; still looks good

close
cp -pr r10-singles.rdb r10-singles-m1.rdb
and reload.

guile -l cogserver-gram.scm
(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 1)
(print-matrix-summary-report star-obj)        ; now its bad.
Error: left and right total pairs not equal! 2758433.0 2723864.0
Error: left and right total counts not equal! 23114818.0 22942644.0

In-group size=2: `,` `;`

OK, fixed I think

Not. Still wrong.  How?
-------------------------------
15 Jan 2022 fixed.

The End
