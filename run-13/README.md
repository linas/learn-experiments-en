Experiment-13
=============
This is not an experiment, it is just a staging area for config
files to do some random explorations of stuff.

Data archive is at
`/home2/linas/src/novamente/data`

Datasets
* `run-1-en_pairs-tranche-12345.rdb` -- I think this is what the name
  implies; its just the pairs.
* `run-1-marg-tranche-12345.rdb` -- above, with marginals ... seems not
  to exist? Presumably because we ran out of RAM to compute the
  marginals? Should we try again?
* `run-1-marg-tranche-1234.rdb` -- Biggest pair file which does have
  marginals.
* `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb` -- Pairs, trimed to 1,1,1, with support
  marginals.
