% Three examples follow; one shows the use of the CogStorageNode, which
% provides network access, and another using RocksStorageNode, which
% provides access to dictionaries located on the local hard drive.
% The last uses the FileStorageNode, which is actually used for the
% demo.

% -----------------------
% CogStorageNode
%
% This will access an AtomSpace over the network, via a CogServer. The
% CogServer must be running, and must be loaded with language data.
%
% #define storage-node "(CogStorageNode \"cog://localhost:19017\")";
#define storage-node "(CogStorageNode \"cog://localhost:19015\")";

% -----------------------
% RocksStorageNode
%
% This will access an AtomSpace on a local hard drive, stored in a
% RocksDB database. The database must hold appropriate language data.
%
% The URL is just a path into the local filesystem.
%
% Uncomment this, and provide a correct file-path.
% #define storage-node "(RocksStorageNode \"rocks:///home2/linas/x13-all-in-one.rdb\")";

% -----------------------
% Additional configuration parameters.

% Sections with missing MI default to an MI=-4 and costs are minus MI.
#define max-disjunct-cost 10;

% Location where costs are stored. The cost will be taken to be
% minus the mutual info (or other additive value) located at the
% the `mi-key` on the Sections. It's assumed that this is a FloatValue,
% which is a vector; the offset is the index into this vector.
#define mi-key "(Predicate \"*-Mutual Info Key cover-section\")";
#define mi-offset 1;

% -----------------------
% At least one bogus entry is needed.
% This file is read as an affix file, so only affix names are allowed.
