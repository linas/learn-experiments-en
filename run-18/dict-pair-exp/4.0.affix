% Affixes get stripped off the left and right side of words
% i.e. spaces are inserted between the affix and the word itself.

% An LPUNC/RPUNC/MPUNC token can be specified as "/regex/.\N", when \N is
% the capture group that should match the affix (the whole pattern is
% capture group 0). Disregarding the position in which they appear, they
% are checked last - but in the same order. (Experimental.)
