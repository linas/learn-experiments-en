Experiment 19
=============
Feb 2023

Big changes since expt-18:
* Change atomspace to use EdgeLink not EvaluationLink
* Major redo of LG for MST parsing.

An unfulfilled goal from run-18:
* Unified pair-parsing, MST-parsing, gram-parsing and clustering,
  as an integrated, continuous system. This remains an out-of-reach
  dream.

Start from scratch:
* pairs
