This is the working directory for the Similarity Smackdown
diary entry. All testing is done on the run-1-en_mpg-tranche-123.rdb
dataset.  To avoid accidental data destruction/confusion, all work
is done here in the run-3 directory.

Datasets:
* r3-mpg-marg.rdb -- copy of full run-1-en_mpg-tranche-123.rdb set,
      with marginals for Sections only, no CrossSections.
      Computed with `guile -l run-common/marginals-mst.scm`
