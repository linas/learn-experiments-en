This is the working directory for examining disjunct distributions.
All testing is done on the run-1-en_mpg-tranche-123.rdb dataset.
To avoid accidental data destruction/confusion, all work is done here
in the run-4 directory.

Datasets:
* r4-mpg-marg.rdb -- copy of full run-1-en_mpg-tranche-123.rdb set,
      with marginals for Sections only, no CrossSections.
      Computed with `guile -l run-common/marginals-mst.scm`
  Actually, this is a copy of `r3-mpg-marg.rdb` because I think that
  dataset was never corrupted, and its already got the marginals in it.


Notes:
Do as the README suggests:
   (cog-rocks-open "rocks:///home/ubuntu/data/r4-mpg-marg.rdb")
   (define pca (make-pseudo-cset-api))
   (define psa (add-pair-stars pca))
   (psa 'fetch-pairs)        ;; Load the dataset
; Elapsed time to load csets: 3961 secs
; Total RAM use 41.3 GB

The ../run-3/README file explains how to create filtered subsets.
