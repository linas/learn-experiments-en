run-5 - Trimming of run-1 word-pair files
=========================================

Lets just take a better look at trimming of word-pair files.
This directory is for messing with that. The final versions
of the data files follow this naming sequence:

 * run-1-prs1-trim-1-1-1.rdb

They're called "run-1" so that they are easier to find, and represent
the "master copies" of the dataset.
