Compute similiary scores.

Use scripts in `learn-lang-diary/utils/similarity-jacc.scm`

(define bover (batch-similarity pcs #f "overlap" -8.0 prt-overlap))
(bover 'batch-compute 10) ; speed about (13.98 sec/pr) or maybe slower ...
(bover 'batch-compute 20) ; speed (7.735 sec/pr)
(bover 'batch-compute 40) ;

(define bcond (batch-similarity pcs #f "condjacc" -8.0 prt-condjacc))
(bcond 'batch-compute 10) ; speed (18.78 sec/pr)
(bcond 'batch-compute 30)
