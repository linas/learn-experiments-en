Run-6: Compute similiary scores
-------------------------------
Explore the two best scores from run-3 (diary part-two) and compare
to MI in greater detail.  The two best were overlap (consistently in
first place) and condjacc (usually second, sometimes 3rd place).
Compare both to MI.

But first, we have to compute them.
Use scripts in `learn-lang-diary/utils/similarity-jacc.scm`
