Run-6: Compute similiary scores
-------------------------------
Sept 2021

Explore the two best scores from run-3 (diary part-two) and compare
to MI in greater detail.  The two best were overlap (consistently in
first place) and condjacc (usually second, sometimes 3rd place).
Compare both to MI.

Results reported in diary Part Three: "Expt-6 – Similarity – Sept 2021"

But first, we have to compute them.
Use scripts in `learn-lang-diary/utils/similarity-jacc.scm`

Data file `r6-similarity.rdb` is a copy of `run-1-t1234-trim-1-1-1.rdb`
with the similarity between the top-ranked 1200 words computed.
This include the MI similarity, the overlap similarity, and the condjacc
similarity.
Problem: the run-1-t1234-trim-1-1-1.rdb file contains disjuncts with
a count of 2 or greater, but a support of only 1. These seem to be ...
junk, and need to be trimmed also.

Data file `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb` trims everything with a support of
only 1.

Data file `r6-similarity-tsup.rdb` is a copy of `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb`
It contains MI similarity for the top-ranked 1200 words. (Same as before)

	(define pca (make-pseudo-cset-api))
	(define psa (add-pair-stars pca))
	(psa 'fetch-pairs)        ;; Load the dataset

======================
Data file `r6-similarity-shape.rdb` is a copy of `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb`
It contain similarity computed with cross-sections.  Like so:
