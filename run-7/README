Starting point is to copy data file `r6-similarity-tsup.rdb` which itself is a
copy of `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb`.  The later trims everything with to have
a support of more than 1.  The former contains MI similarity for the top-ranked
1200 words.


(define pca (make-pseudo-cset-api))
(define pcs (add-pair-stars pca))

(define sap (add-similarity-api pcs))

(pcs 'fetch-pairs)
(sap 'fetch-pairs) ;;; same as (load-atoms-of-type 'Similarity)
