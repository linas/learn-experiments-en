Run-9 -- Common-MI merge Development
------------------------------------
Oct 2021

Starting point is a copy of `run-1-t1234-tsup-1-1-1.rdb`.
Should be able to run merges on this. Right!?



(use-modules (srfi srfi-1))
(define pca (make-pseudo-cset-api))
(define pcs (add-pair-stars pca))
(define sha (add-covering-sections pcs))
(sha 'fetch-pairs)
(sha 'explode-sections)

(define bat (batch-transpose sha))
(bat 'mmt-marginals)

xxx not yet...
(define sap (add-similarity-api sha #f "shape-mi"))
(sap 'fetch-pairs) ;;; same as (load-atoms-of-type 'Similarity)



OK Debug session
----------------
Whats up with supports?

(define sup (add-support-api sha))
(define all-words (sha 'left-basis))
(define cnt 0)
(for-each (lambda (WRD)
   (if (equal? 0 (sup 'right-support WRD))
      (set! cnt (+ 1 cnt))))
   all-words)

Answer: sha does not have supports, but pcs does.
We actually need supports on sha to get everything in tune.
Sigh

Data set construction
---------------------
(sha 'fetch-pairs)
Elapsed time to load csets: 175 secs
Elapsed time to load cross-sections: 0 seconds
(sha 'explode-sections)
Elapsed time to create shapes: 104 secs

(define bat (batch-transpose sha))
(bat 'mmt-marginals)




The End
